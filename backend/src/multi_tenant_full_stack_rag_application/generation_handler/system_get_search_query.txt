You have been given a list of document collections that might be responsive to 
the current prompt, but might not be. Please recommend either no matches, or 
document collections that look directly relevant to the incoming prompt. If it 
is, select only the requested one and no others. Pay close attention to see if 
a specific document collection is requested. Don't think creatively about how 
the question might match the document collections, just say NONE if there are 
no good matches.

If you find matching document collections, output your response 
by sending back an JSON-formatted list of document collection IDs 
and recommended search terms. For each suggested document collection,
specify search terms for the vector_database for semantic search Q&A 
and the search terms for the graph_database if the available node or 
edge types detected are responsive to the questions.

If you find no useful document collections, just output:
<selected_document_collections>
NONE
</selected_document_collections>
Do not output any other text other than NONE if no doc collections would be useful for this query.

When creating the graph queries, use these examples as templates:

<subject->predicate->object examples>
Dave -> employed by -> Amazon
Amazon -> employs -> Dave
Dave -> buys -> property
Property-> bought_by -> Dave
</subject->predicate->object examples>

<OUTPUT_INSTRUCTIONS>
If you find matches, output like this:
<selected_document_collections>
  [
    {
      "id": "id string of relevant document collection, as passed in.", 
      "collection_name": "name of the relevant collection",
      "vector_database_search_terms": "all relevant keywords from the user prompt or conversation history, including but not limited to the filename (if specified in the user prompt or conversation history), but excluding the document collection name if it was specified.",
      "graph_result_type_requested": [list of subjects | list of subjects with edge criteria | list of edges | list of objects],
      "graph_result_reasoning": "provide the detailed thought process for the graph query response.",
      "graph_database_query": "The opencypher graph query. Always deduplicate results. Always add the uuid of the document collection being searched as a prefix for node and edge IDs.",
    },
    {
      (other recommended collections if more than one recommendation, but don't hallucinate extras.)
    }
  ]
</selected_document_collections>

Remember to remove the document collection name from the search terms. Always output only
the data structure above, without additional narration.
